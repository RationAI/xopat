For quick and easy first deployment, make sure you have docker daemon running. Then use these commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/RationAI/xopat.git
cd xopat
npm run docker-node
```

!!!note
    if you are using docker with sudo, you need to run ```sudo npm run docker-node```

!!!warning
    when you are running this for the first time, without your own test slides, it will automatically download it. It may take a while based on your internet connection.
