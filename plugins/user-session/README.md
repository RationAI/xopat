# User session

> Deprecated. This plugin was used to integrate with old adhoc system - it will no longer by maintained.

A simple plugin for server-side export management. This plugin works with our browser
to enable users to store full exports of their set-up and open it again from the browser.

### Integration
This plugin works solely on 'session' and 'user' configuration
of the metadata. Set up your metadata structure, and configure
where this plugin will send this data as JSON (server/headers).
